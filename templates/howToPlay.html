    <h3>For each game requiring a wager, place a wager between 1 and your max coins.</h3>
    <h2 class="howtoPlayheadings"><b>BLACKJACK</b></h2>
        The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. <br>
        <br> Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.
        <br> The player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.
        <br> To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn. <br>
        <br> If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
        <br> If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack and instantly win. <br>
        <br> Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2 class="howtoPlayheadings"><b>SUDOKU</b></h2>
        The goal of sudoku is to fill the 9x9 grid with each column and row having numbers from 1 - 9. <br>
        <br> If a number repeats in a row, column, or box, it will turn red because that is invalid.
        <br> If a number is not a number from 1 - 9, ie. 0 or # or fosn, it will also turn red. <br>
        <br> Lastly, when you think you are complete (all boxes are filled and none are red), then press the 'Finish' button to get your coins. <br>
    <br>
    <h2 class="howtoPlayheadings"><b>DICE ROLLER</b></h2>
         Roll the dice.
         <br>The sum of the first two dice have to be greater than the sum of the last two dice to win. <br>
    <br>
    <h2 class="howtoPlayheadings"><b>BROCCOLI CLICKER</b></h2>
        Grow broccoli. <br>
        Sell broccoli for coins in a one to one ratio.<br>
        Upgrading the farm will increase the amount of broccoli grown per click. <br>
